# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I use to customize my system

## Current setup

1. **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04
2. **Window manager**: Gnome
3. **Shell**: Zsh
4. **Terminal**: Guake
5. **Editor**: Neovim. CLion/PyCharm with IdeaVim when required.
6. **Browser**: Mozilla Firefox

## Editors

My preferred editor is Neovim. Even then, I am good with keyboard shortcuts in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs. I have also occassionally used Org Mode in emacs.

## Gnome extensions

- [Dash to Panel](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/) for a auto-collapsing taskbar that allows Win-X app-opening as well as Win-Q to reveal taskbar

## Firefox extensions

At some point I had twenty extensions, now I have reduced them to a dozen. These are my favorite:

1. uBlock origin: to avoid web tracking
2. Tampermonkey: I maintain or use more than a dozen userscripts
3. Vimium: comfortable web navigation
4. Leechblock: avoid distraction deliberately
5. Facebook Container: wall of Facebook trackers
6. I don't care about cookies: does what it says
7. Refined GitHub: excellent github customizations
8. Competitive coding: CF-Predictor and Competitive Companion
