This is a list of productivity programs that I use in my terminal, and would want to reinstall in new laptop. This list only includes those software that are not covered by the other rc files. Ideally, everytime I install a new software I update this list

1. bat: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat
2. fzf: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
3. uget download manager
4. SafeEyes for taking breaks from the pc
5. Multigit status https://github.com/fboender/multi-git-status
